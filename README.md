Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) models are capable of detecting a large proportion of spoken words from a video of a person speaking. However, the resulting transcriptions are typically incoherent, lack punctuation and contain significant errors. To address this limitation, this project introduces a pipeline that integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) to refine the raw VSR output, leveraging the semantic and contextual understanding power of LLMs to reconstruct more accurate and meaningful text.

The full pipeline processes videos of a single visible speaker and generates natural-sounding audio output. It works in five main steps:

0. **Lip Movement Detection** – The video is analyzed for the presence of lip movements; the pipeline is only activated if a speaker is detected.

1. **Speech Extraction** – Lip movements are analyzed to extract the spoken text.

2. **Text Refinement** – An LLM cleans and improves the extracted text for readability and accuracy.

3. **Voice Synthesis** – The speaker’s age and gender are estimated to select an appropriate voice, which is then used to generate the final audio file.

4. **Audio Comparison** – If the input video already contains speech audio, it is transcribed to compare with the extracted text.

The result is an end-to-end system that converts the lip movements in a video into clear, lifelike speech, while also supporting validation against original audio when available.

## Example

Below are three versions of an [actor’s monologue from a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDhszbGqBmk): (1) the original transcript from the audio, (2) the raw output generated by the VSR model, and (3) the refined version of the VSR text after processing with the LLM.

(1)  You understand? Yeah, I mean, of course you'd say that. Such a typical thing for a therapist to say. You know what? Let's just cut the crap, alright? I'm not stupid. I know that you could care less about me or my problems. And all you really care about is getting that money at the end of this session. So you know what? Let's make a deal. You know, I'm fine with just sitting here an hour a week on my phone. You can do whatever it is that you do. Then my mom will be happy because I'm here and you'll be happy because you get your money. Now do we have a deal? Or would you rather just keep playing this fake sympathetic therapist that pretends to care about her clients and I'll just go along being the gullible patient who thinks that I finally have someone who wants to help me. Either way, you get your money and I understand that's all you really want. And scene.

(2) you understand yeah i mean of course you can say that such a typical thing for the top so you say oh you know what let's just on the crap right i'm not stupid i know that you can hear less time to care less time about me who would be problems and all you really care about is that that money at that discussion so you know what you know what let's make a dealer i'm fine when she's sitting here and how are we on my phone you can do whatever it's like you do i think my mom will be happy because the mirror and and you'll be happy because it gets your money and i also have a deal or would you rather just complain this finger simulating therapist that pretends to care about her clients and all just going on me and the carbon patient who thinks that i finally have someone who wants to help me wants to help me in a way you get your money and you say that's all you really want really was i said

(3) You understand? Yeah, I mean, of course you can say that. It's such a typical thing for a therapist to say. You know what? Let's just cut the crap. I'm not stupid. I know you couldn't care less about me or my problems. All you really care about is the money from this session. So, let's make a deal. I'll sit here on my phone, and you can do whatever it is you do. My mom will be happy because I'm here, and you'll be happy because you get your money. So, do we have a deal? Or would you rather we just continue this charade? You, playing the therapist who pretends to care about her clients, and me, the gullible patient who thinks I've finally found someone who wants to help me. Either way, you get your money. That's all you really want, isn't it?


**Result:** The word error rate (WER) between the original speech transcript (1) and the raw VSR output (2) is **58.24%**. After refinement with the LLM (3), that number decreases to **38.24%**. Although the WER remains relatively high, it primarily reflects syntactic mismatches rather than differences in meaning. A semantic comparison reveals that while the raw VSR output (2) diverges substantially from the original speech, the refined version (3) preserves the core meaning and intent almost entirely. This demonstrates that the pipeline effectively transforms noisy VSR output into coherent text that accurately represents the speaker’s message.
